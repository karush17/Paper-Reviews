# Paper Reviews

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of short reviews of papers in Deep Learning. Reviews are based on papers which explore novel groundbreaking ideas or consist of theoretically rich concepts. A total of 2 short reviews are typically added each week which explore essential aspects of the work, its technical innovation and new questions and ideas raised by the work. Length of each review is 1 page excluding references. Each review is based on a fixed set of guidlines which are given [here](#guidlines). If you would like to contribute to the reviews then please read [this](#contributions).

## <a name="guidlines"></a>Review Guildines
This section outlines the guidlines which are used to write reviews for the repository. Note that these guidlines must be strictly followed for providing high quality reviews to the reader. 

### Paper Selection
Since Deep Learning is a fast-moving field, papers can span a broad variety of topics. In order to shorten the range of literature, papers must be selected using the following rules-  
* Any review paper, survey or a long articles should not be considered since these are themselves a review of previous works and reviewing them would defeat the purpose of literature writing.
* Short paper, Journal papers and theoretical works are suitable as these present a single idea which may be of interest to the reader.
* Papers containing experimental results balanced with theory are encouraged as these validate the practical applications of the proposed methods.
* There is no constraint on the publication date and time of papers. However, papers which date back to the 'AI Winter' are highly encouraged since these provide insights which were never looked at for a very long time.
* Papers containing simply applications of pre-existing methods to various regimes are not preferred since they do not provide any new insights into the algorithm itself and only deal with its applicability.
* Workshop papers and incomplete works are also welcome as researchers can always build on these ideas.
* While there is no specific restriction on the content of papers, reviewer must consider fields in AI which are growing and require a new outlook, eg. Reinforcement Learning, Gradient-Free methods, Meta-Learning, Natural Language at Scale, Exlainability, etc.


### Introduction
This section provides points on writing a good introduction for the review. Note that these review points are not strict and only serve as a guiding principle for drafting a good introduction.  
* The introduction should be a high-level idea of the paper and what the work deals with.
* The reviewer must refrain from going into any technical detail and highlight the broad idea of the work and its scope.
* A possible checklist of questions one might want to answer while writing a good introduction is as followed-
